The MTGBot.tv website
======

This is the github for the mtgbot.tv website. I'm looking for coders who are willing to help me add and develop mtgbot's front end website into an interactive twitch application. The code isn't terribly pretty, but if you are interested in helping out I would be greatly appreciated.

Most of the code for how the drafts/mtgo messages get relayed to the proxy are in a different program. Please work with me if you would like more messages to send to the server (Game starts, tournament starts, game status (wins/losses), deck submissions, etc...) don't hesistate to ask.

Thanks again for stopping by.
